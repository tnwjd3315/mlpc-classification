James Shiel

I used my extra alarm clock as my Sonic Object for this project. It served no needs in my room and I felt an object that already blasts noise could be repurposed for my needs.  My goal with the alarm clock is to take the simple audio device to its next level.  Alarm clocks blast beeping or music to wake up their owners, but why not take their output a bit further? Perhaps I could change it to still act as an alarm clock, but one that uses more extreme tactics to wake up its owner, while still relying entirely on audio to do so.  Perhaps rather than just annoying noises, my alarm clock will play even more motivating noises, like nails on a chalkboard, snoring, strange laughing, uncomfortable bodily noises, or even blatantly terrible or out of key music.  Behind all this I could add an incredibly high-pitched buzz that persists until the owner turns it off. Many of these sounds translated quite well in my piece.  Uncomfortable laughter, irritable buzzing, off key combinations of notes and all around chaos created the “get out of bed now” effect I was aiming for.  I was disappointed that my idea for “psychological triggers” or speech at all in my piece didn’t work with the rest of my sound.  I recorded a number of voices and had a character in mind that my clock might affect, but the speech did more to harm my piece’s impact than to help it, and I decided to leave them out. 
I put a good amount of work into the appearance of the clock as well.  Broken buttons and traces of blood on the top makes it really appear as if it’s being smashed in frustration every morning, and makes it seem all the more vial of a noise machine.
If I were to re do this assignment, I would think more about pacing, as my classmates agreed its climax was weaker than it could have been.  Overall though, I was happy with my piece. It’s irritable and unwelcomed, even to the point I found myself sweating as I worked on it.  As a complete package it definitely looks and sounds as I had hoped: like an alarm clock from hell.

I downloaded them, cleaned them, made lots of improvements - and finally remastered them.

Then I used the seven remastered files to create The Brothel! I mixed these sounds to make it even more exotic!

I could've made lots of more changes, however, I wanted to leave the rest up to the listener's fantasy.

It was much about planning, knowing what sounds to use, and how to use the different sounds, and timing!

If you enjoyed the sound, please STAR, COMMENT, SPREAD THE WORD!🗣 It really helps! 🎯

NOTE: Make sure to check out the other sounds! The sound quality is <b>always</b> better when you download the sound(s)! ⭐

Enjoy!

There is often a guy feeding te ducks. I was there with my mic in the backpack and asked him if he could continue to feed the ducks while I could place the mic in the middle of the feeding spot. At first the ducks were scared because of this strange microphon standing there. So I put some autumn leafs on it to camouflage it. So, this worked and the ducks started to walk around the mic and eat the bread. 

What you can hear ist the giggling of the mallards and the sonourus sound of the mandarin ducks. Also you have quite the rush of a near located highway in the back :-/ I had to cut a little bit, because the ""duck man"" was talking along and some passers-by, but I wanted to keep it clean from human voices.

This drama sucked. Intentionally. I don't want to make a real drama. (I probably couldn't if I tried.)

This sound was made with a headset mic and GarageBand (the violin part).

If you need the script:

Mary: But Johnny, I love you!
Johnny: But Mary, you don't understand!
Mary: What don't I understand?
Johnny: I-- I am--...

I made this recording two days before the opening of the 2024 Olympic games taking place in Paris, while the Olympic torchbearers were running through Nanterre, in the western suburbs of the French capital. 
Here, we are at the starting point of the run (at Gabriel Péri stadium), and one can hear hundreds of people waiting and cheering, while loud speakers broadcast some music and the comments of the master of ceremony standing a few meters further. 
After a few seconds, the MC  introduces the Olympic torch which just arrived in our town from an other city (at #0:39), as well as some of the famous bearers who will hold it during the run in our place. 
Then, at #2:09, the first bearer from our town, who is a famous basketball player named Benjamin Sene, will get the torch from the guards, while the MC explains that it is about 70cm high and 1,5 Kg, and that every bearer will run during 200 meters along the streets, before giving it to the next runner. 
Then, after some additional words and some cheering, the final countdown starts at #3:48, and the bearer goes running with the Olympic torch !
